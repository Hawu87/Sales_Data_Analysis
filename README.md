Welcome to the Sales Analysis & Visualization project repository! This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline involving Google BigQuery and Tableau for in-depth sales data exploration and visualization.

Project Overview
In this project, we embarked on a journey to uncover actionable insights from an extensive sales dataset. Leveraging the power of Google BigQuery, advanced SQL queries and data transformations were performed to identify key trends, analyze customer behaviors, and assess performance metrics.

Once the data had been analyzed and prepared, Tableau was employed to create a series of interactive dashboards and visually engaging visualizations. These dashboards serve as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to gain a holistic understanding of the sales landscape.
